### Create a new React app (optional)

If you don't have an existing React app, you can quickly create a new app by using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/):

```bash
npx create-react-app okta-app
```

Go into your root app directory to view the created files:

```bash
cd okta-app
```

### Install dependencies

Add the [latest version of Okta Auth JS](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/releases) (`@okta/okta-auth-js`), the [latest version Okta React SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-React/releases)(`@okta/okta-react`), and the `react-router-dom` libraries to your React app. You can install them by using `npm` from your root app directory:

```bash
npm install @okta/okta-auth-js@latest
npm install @okta/okta-react@latest
npm install react-router-dom
```
