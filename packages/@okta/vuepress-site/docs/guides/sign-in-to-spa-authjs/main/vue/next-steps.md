After you've completed a basic-sign flow Vue.js app, you can extend your app's sign-in experience by adding features such as multifactor or social IdP authentication. 

NEED TO ADD SEQUENCE DIAGRAM and additional info to handle Interaction Code flow for these use cases!

These features are enabled by configuring your Okta org and the sign-on policies for your app.

* See [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case)
* See [Set up your Okta org for a social IdP use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-social-idp-use-case)
* See [Sign in with Facebook using the Widget](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-widget-use-case-sign-in-soc-idp/) for an example of a web application that uses the Sign-In Widget with social IdP authentication.

> **Note**: Identity Engine org configuration is supported by the Admin Console and by the Okta API.
