If you want to deploy a React single-page app (SPA) in the embedded authentication model, where your app retains authentication control without redirection to Okta, then you can use the Okta Sign-In Widget (SIW) to quickly add authentication. The Okta SIW is a JavaScript library that includes full sign-in features with Okta Identity Engine so the amount of authentication code you have to write for your app is minimal.

Before you build your React app, ensure that you [set up](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#get-set-up) your [Okta org for your use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-your-use-case) and [register your React app in Okta](#register-your-app-in-okta).
